# Moroccan Stocks Clustering

> In progress

We use k-means to cluster 70 moroccan stock prices to see their influence on market trends indicated by the MASI (Moroccan All Shares Index) index,
for the case of time series k-means uses DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) metric which is a better indicator for similiarity for time series data.
